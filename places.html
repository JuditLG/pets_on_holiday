          <h2>Our recommendations</h2>
          <h3>Balatonfoldvar</h3>
          <p>Balatonfoldvar opened a dog-friendly beach this summer, allowing you to enjoy the cooling down in the water with your dog on a hot summer day. Szandra Haz, a self-contained apartment house with garden and swimming pool is a short drive from the dog-friendly beach.</p>

          <h3>Fonyod</h3>
          <p>Fonyod also offers a dog-friendly beach, where you can swim with your dog and enjoy the sunshine. Tappancs (Paws) apartment house is within a short walking distance, and needless to say, dogs are welcome.</p>

          <h3>Keszthely</h3>
          <p>While there is no dog-friendly beach in Keszthely, Abbazia Club Hotel offers dog-friendly accommodation with wellness facilities. Dog-supervising services are also available if you wish to visit tourist attractions, such as the Festetics Palace or the Marzipan Museum, where dogs are not allowed - what a shame!</p>
